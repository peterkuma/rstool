# rstool

rstool is an open source command-line program for converting radiosonde
measurement data to NetCDF and calculation of derived physical quantities. It
can also be used for the calculation of derived quantities from source
quantities, such as exporting variables along a vertical profile from a model
and letting rstool calculate the derived quantities (`rstool prof prof` *input*
*output*).

Supported instruments:

- [InterMet Systems](https://www.intermetsystems.com) (iMet) radiosondes, such
  as iMet-1-ABxn, data files produced by the iMetOS-II software (a directory
  containing `.dat` and `.flt` files).
- [Windsond](http://windsond.com/), data files produced by the Windsond
  software (`.sounding`).

Support for other instruments can be added by writing a Python module in
`rstool/drivers` to read the data files produced by the radiosonde (see the
template in `rstool/drivers/template.py`).

## Usage

rstool converts radiosonde measurement data to NetCDF intrument-dependent
intermediate (`im`), points (`pts`), and profile (`prof`) datasets and
calculates derived physical quantities.

Usage: **rstool** *input_type* *output_type* *input* [*surface*] *output*

Arguments:

- *input_type*: See Input types below.
- *output_type*: See Output types below.
- *input*: Input file or directory.
- *surface*: Near-surface variables (NetCDF).
- *output*: Output file (NetCDF).

Input types:

- `imet`: InterMet Systems iMet-1-ABxn sounding. `input` should be a directory
  generated by the iMetOS-II software, containing `.dat` and `.flt` files.
- `prof`: rstool profile (`prof`) format (NetCDF).
- `pts`: rstool points (`pts`) format (NetCDF). Collection of measurement
  points, not interpolated to any vertical coordinates. The output of running
  rstool with the output type `pts`.
- `im:`*instrument*: Instrument-dependent intermediate (`im`) rstool format
  (NetCDF). *instrument* is one of `imet` or `ws`.
- `ws`: Windsond sounding. `input` should be a `.sounding` file generated by the
  Windsond software.

Output types:

- `pts`: Collection of measurement points (NetCDF).
- `prof`: Vertical profile calculated by interpolating the measurement points
  during the ascent of the radiosonde as a function of pressure (NetCDF).
- `prof:desc`: The same as `prof`, but for the descending path of the
  radiosonde (if present in the input data).
- `im`: Instrument-dependent intermediate rstool format (NetCDF).

The following input/output type combinations are possible, where *instrument*
is `imet` or `ws`:

- *instrument* `im`: Native instrument format to instrument-dependent
  intermediate format (NetCDF).
- *instrument* `pts`: Native instrument format to the points format.
- *instrument* `prof`: Native instrument format to the profile format.
- *instrument* `prof:desc`: Native instrument format to a descending profile
  format.
- `im:`*instrument* `pts`: Instrument-dependent intermediate format (NetCDF) to
  the points format.
- `im:`*instrument* `prof`: Instrument-dependent intermediate format (NetCDF)
  to the profile format.
- `im:`*instrument* `prof:desc`: Instrument-dependent intermediate format
  (NetCDF) to the descending profile format.
- `pts prof`: The points format to the profile format.
- `pts prof:desc`: The points format to the descending profile format.
- `prof prof`: The profile format to the profile format. This can be used to
  calculate derived physical quantities from a set source quantities.

## Examples

## Calculation of derived physical quantities

rstool calculates a number of physical quantities from a set of source physical
quantities, such as different humidity quantities (water vapor partial
pressure, mixing ratio, specific humidity, relative humidity, and dew point
temperature), potential temperature, lifting condensation level, and eastward
and northward wind. This is done when converting from a native instrument
format, the instrument-dependent intermediate (`im`) format, the points (`pts`)
format, or the profile (`prof`) format to the profile (`prof`) format.
Conversion of quantities is performed recursively from source to derived
quantities through any number of steps required. Supported elementary quantity
conversions are the following (*source quantities* ðŸ ¢ *derived quantities*):

## Format description

Below is a description of the output NetCDF formats. Time is expressed as
Julian date (fractional number of days since -4712-01-01 12:00 UTC, or
-4713-11-24 12:00 UTC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar). This can be
converted to UNIX time (number of non-leap seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00
UTC) with the forumula `(time - 2440587.5)*86400`.

The formats can be converted in the order from intrument-depedent intermediate
(`im:`*instrument*) to points (`pts`) to profile (`prof`).

All variables are stored either as 64-bit floating point (float64) or 64-bit
integer (int64). Missing values are stored as NaN in float64 and
-9223372036854775806 in int64.

### Points (pts)

pts is an instrument-independent format containing a sequence of radiosonde
measurements as received by the base station ordered by time, converted to a
standard set of variables.

| Variable | Long name | Standard name | Units |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hur | relative humidity | relative_humidity | % |
| hurs | near-surface relative humidity | relative_humidity | % |
| lat | latitude | latitude | degree North |
| lon | longitude | longitude | degree East |

| ps | surface air pressure | surface_air_pressure | Pa |

| station_z | station altitude | height_above_reference_ellipsoid | m |
| station_time | station time | time | days since -4713-11-24 12:00 UTC |

| vas | northward near-surface wind | northward_wind | m.s<sup>-1</sup> |
| z | altitude | height_above_reference_ellipsoid | m |

### Profile (prof)

prof is an instrument-independent format containing standard variables
interpolated as a function of height. Profiles are calculated by averaging
points (`pts`) on a regular vertical pressure grid. For calculation of an
ascending profile (default), only strictly increasing subsets of points are
considered. For a descending profile (`prof:desc`), only strictly decreasing
subsets of points are considered. Vertical intervals with no points are filled
with missing values. It is therefore possible to identify vertical intervals
where no radiosonde data were received, and optionally interpolate (linearly or
in some other way) across these intervals when plotting.

### Surface (surf)

surf dataset specifies near-surface variables, which can be used as an optional
input to rstool. These can come from a co-located automatic weather station
(AWS). Some native radiosonde data can already contain the same of these
variables (iMet). Near-surface variables are needed to calculate some derived
profile variables, such as the lifting condensation level. All variables must
have a single dimension of `time`. The point nearest to the radiosonde launch
time is picked. If no points are within 1 hour of the radiosonde launch, the
surface input is ignored.  Either (`uas`, `vas`) or (`wdds`, `wdss`) can be
defined.  Either `hurs` or (`ps`, `tas`, `tds`) can be defined.
